            <p>TeamViewer is a remote access and support tool that enables employees to connect to their computers 
                and devices from virtually anywhere. At ASICS, the IT Team utilizes TeamViewer to assist employees 
                who are working remotely. When an employee encounters a technical issue and needs help troubleshooting, 
                they can request support from IT. Using TeamViewer, the IT Team can securely connect to the employee's 
                computer and resolve the issue directly.
